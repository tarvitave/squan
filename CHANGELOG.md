# Changelog

All notable changes to Squan are documented here.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-04-15

### 🆕 MCP Extension Support
- **MCP Client**: Agents connect to external MCP tool servers (stdio + HTTP transports)
- **Extension Config UI**: Settings → Extensions tab to add/remove MCP servers
- **Tool Discovery**: Agents auto-discover tools from connected MCP servers
- **Prefixed Names**: MCP tools use `serverName__toolName` to avoid collisions
- Works with 1000+ community MCP servers (databases, Slack, Jira, GitHub, etc.)

### 🆕 Multi-Model Provider Support
- **Provider Abstraction**: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI-compatible
- **Settings UI**: AI Provider tab with model grid and API key management
- **Per-user Config**: Each user can choose their own provider + model
- **Ollama**: Run local models with no API key needed
- **Cost Tracking**: Adjusted per-provider pricing

### 🆕 Built-in Skills (formerly Recipes)
- **Skill System**: Multi-step declarative workflows for chaining agent tasks
- **4 Built-in Skills**: Test→Fix→PR, Review→Refactor, Generate Docs, Security Audit
- **Skills API**: CRUD endpoints (`/api/skills`)
- Loadable from `.squan/skills/` directory per project

### 🆕 Web Browsing Tools
- **fetch_url**: HTTP GET with HTML→text conversion for readability
- **search_web**: DuckDuckGo instant answer API integration
- Both available as built-in tools for all agents

### 🔧 State Recovery on Restart
- `loadData()` retries 3x with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s)
- Red error banner with Retry button if data fails to load
- Stale auth tokens auto-clear (forces re-login)
- Working/idle agents marked 'done' on restart (not zombie)
- Sidebar refresh button (↻) for manual data reload

### 🔧 Agent Chat Fix
- Fixed FollowUpInput pushed off-screen for long conversations
- Changed layout from `h-full` to `flex-1 min-h-0` for proper flex constraint

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-14

### 🆕 Post-Completion Agent Interaction
- **Follow-up input bar** — always visible at the bottom of agent chat, allowing you to send follow-up questions or new instructions even after an agent finishes
- **Completion Action Bar** — inline card after agent completes with two clear paths:
  - "Mark Complete & Advance Board" — moves release train to PR Review
  - "or type below to continue" — keeps the conversation going
- **`POST /api/workerbees/:id/followup`** — server endpoint to resume agent conversations
- **`POST /api/workerbees/:id/mark-complete`** — server endpoint to manually advance kanban
- Agent child processes stay alive after completion (no `process.exit`) to support follow-up IPC messages

### 🔧 Kanban Board Improvements
- **Inline agent actions** — when agent is done but task still in "In Progress", shows "💬 View Chat" and "✓ Mark Complete" buttons directly on the card
- **Fixed status sync** — agent status now correctly propagates from server to kanban cards (fixed `workerbeeId` → `workerBeeId` camelCase mismatch in WebSocket events)
- **Client-side fallback** — `workerbee.done` event auto-advances assigned release train to PR Review in the store
- **Resilient field parsing** — WebSocket handler reads both `workerBeeId` and `workerbeeId` variants

### ✏️ Task Editor Improvements
- **Fixed focus jumping** — replaced callback ref with `useRef` + `useEffect` for one-time auto-focus (typing in description no longer jumps cursor to name field)
- **Larger text fields** — description textarea is now 4 rows with `min-h-[80px]`
- **Pop-out modal editor** — expand icon (↗) opens a full-screen modal with labeled fields for writing detailed agent instructions
- Agent name click in kanban now navigates directly to Agent chat view

## [0.3.11] - 2026-04-13
